# Deprecated Context Workflow Artifacts

This folder quarantines legacy context-sync systems to prevent merge conflicts,
duplicate instructions, and stale credential references.

Active workflow replacement:
- Canonical file: `RILEY_CONTEXT.md`
- Canonical append/push script: `scripts/eod_append.sh`

Nothing here is deleted; files are preserved for reference.
