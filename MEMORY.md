# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Context

## About Riley

Riley is an entrepreneur, content creator, and Chick-fil-A restaurant operations leader building in the AI space. "Multi-channel dumper" — captures ideas across texts, voice memos, screenshots, AI chats, playlists. Bias toward speed over organization at capture time.

### Core Traits
- Working Style: Rapid iteration, minimal friction, direct communication
- Design Eye: Clean, minimal, non-generic. Gets distracted by formatting options.
- Decision-Making: Context over structure. Speed over perfection.
- Communication: Direct and efficient. No fluff.

## Active Projects (Priority Order)

### 1. YouTube Channel
Target: non-technical frontline operational managers. Focus: practical AI + Apple tutorials. First video: "You're Using AI Wrong" — teaching people to treat AI like a junior employee. Style refs: Nate B. Jones, Aleric Heck, Fireship, Igor Pogany. Script and production plan complete.

### 2. Daily AI Audio Brief
15-20 min solo-narration briefings covering breaking AI news. Sources: The Rundown AI, Ben's Bites, TechCrunch AI, arXiv, X/Reddit. Spotlight triggers: major AI figures, viral posts.

### 3. Armor App
Scripture memorization using Fighter Verses methodology. Gamified 5-mechanic ladder: Word Bank → Word Scramble → Type 1st Letter → Type Full Word → Recite Out Loud. Each mechanic has L1-L5 levels with strict gating. Data sets A-E with ESV verses ready. Full IA blueprint exists at RileyFile/RileyProjects/ARMOR APP.

### 4. HarmonyHelper
Piano practice app. Python backend, web frontend. At /Desktop/HarmonyApp/.

### 5. AI Operations Monitor (NEXT BUILD)
Vision: Local agent that monitors all AI activity on machine — processes running, token spend, efficiency. Eventually orchestrates which AI handles which task. Like a conductor for non-technical people. Design phase.

### 6. Dashboard App (RileyHQ)
Productivity command center. Zero manual maintenance, proactive insights. Design discovery phase.

## Key Interests
- Psychology of AI, human-AI interaction
- Mission: Democratize AI for non-technical audiences
- Architecture & strategy, early adoption signals
- Individual use cases across demographics

## System & Workflow
- Capture: iOS Share Sheet shortcuts, voice dictation, back-tap trigger
- Organization: Hashtags over folders, auto-routing by keywords
- File Structure: RileyShare (landing zone), RileyNotes (#hashtag notes), RileyProjects (active work)
- Platforms: Mac + iPhone + iPad cross-platform

## Important Preferences
- NotebookLM audio overviews → readable transcripts
- Copy/paste-friendly outputs
- Specific over vague
- No excessive bullets/hierarchy

## Lessons Learned (2026-02-15)
- OpenClaw consumed tokens overnight with no monitoring. Local agents need spending limits, single-model configs, and monitoring before deployment.
- API keys should never be hardcoded in shell configs.
- Agent personality files (SOUL.md etc.) add overhead without clear ROI for current workflow.
- Build the monitor BEFORE deploying more agents.
